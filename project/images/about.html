        My name is Alice Liu, I am a junior dual at Public Relations and Information Management & Technology. I am passionate about strategic communications and coordinating. I strive to use my communication skills to bridge the gap between people. Realizing that we are living such a diverse culture, everyone has their stories to tell, I am a listener with empathy. 
I love asking questions and doing so called “connecting the dots”. Having an open mind with everything and keeping learning, I want to use my international background to help with the international communication.

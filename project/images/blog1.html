        Abstract
This paper takes a deeper look at Public Relations at the health communication field. Throughout the paper, there is a simple historical context in this profession. Additionally, some contents of analysing the skills, advantages and disadvantages, and prospects for the future are provided. It also includes the comparison with other professional fields, as well as a personal review. The paper concludes with the current situation of health communication and some future ideas. 
 
A Study of Health Communication 
Communication has its strong power, it is the channel for people to share their ideas; it plays an important role in every organization. One key objective of health communication is to “engage, empower, and influence individuals and communities” (Schiavo, 2013). This goal may sound very wonderful and abstract, but the most basic purpose for health communication is to “improve health outcomes by sharing health-related information to the public” (Schiavo, 2013). The outbreak of COVID-19 has been such a huge global health crisis, information and instructions sent by authorities are essential for the public to realize the current situation and take actions. 
Overview
Public Relations has been so widely defined that different aspects have different definitions. In Health Communications, specialists “help others understand more about medical treatment, healthy lifestyle choice, disease prevention” (Page & Parnell, 2019). As it focuses on the information from the health-care field, the audience usually plays a role as either health care worker, or patients. People have been focused more on health; this growth of health awareness brings new communication challenges, and is the key reason why health communication has become a strong area in Public Relations (Page & Parnell, 2019).
History
In the early 1970s, the field of health communication started to formalize, but the root of health communication can be traced back to early Greeks (Tompson, 2014). People living in the 21st century put more and more awareness on health issues. Prior to that, the United States has already had a rich history of campaigns addressing public health issues, such as alcohol abuse, improper handling and storage of food. Health communication professionals developed scientific methods to study the communication within health context for decades (Wright et al., 2012). Since health is more related with scientific research, the early formation of this area was tied closely with the presentation of those research results. In the book Health Communication in the 21st century, the author talks a lot about two important publication outlets for health communication researchers. The first issue of Health Communication was in early 1989. After that, the Journal of Health Communication followed in 1996. These two publications had a significant meaning in the growth of health communication as a new area (Wright et al., 2012). Today people believe that it is important for people to have this environment and realize the sense of keeping healthy. 
Advantages and Disadvantages
Within the jobs of public communication, there are advantages and disadvantages. One of the advantages is that it has a broad choice. In the book  Introduction to strategic public relations, the author talks about clients in health communication specialized agencies. For example, the client could be pharmaceutical or medical companies, hospitals, health-care startups, retail pharmacy chains, and nonprofit organizations (Page & Parnell, 2019). This allows health communication experts to take different roles and tasks; this is a positive aspect of this area which can increase their oversight and thus have more control of their careers. 
Speaking of working independently, this could be a disadvantage or advantage, depending on how it is viewed. Health communication cannot work without other public health agencies and marketing strategies (Schiavo, 2013). Besides, if the local infrastructure is poor, the health communication job is limited. This is clearly a disadvantage, because regions with lacking infrastructure will not have a large market for health service. 
Comparison in Other Fields
There are similarities in the field of health communication that appears in other fields. The first is the crisis management in public relations. Last year with the pandemic, governments and health agencies needed to figure out the solution to this crisis. Also, one of the purposes of health communication Schiavo talks about in her book is that it helps to influence the research agendas, and “support the need for additional funds for medical and scientific discovery” (Schiavo, 2013). This is very close to political communication, which includes strategic messaging to key public, fund-raising efforts (Page & Parnell, 2019). They both involve in the decision of where the fund goes.
Another similarity to health communication is advertising. Advertisements need good storytelling to sell the product. Basically what health communication does is selling products related with health issues. 
Although there are different specializations in Public Relations, there are still similarities in health communication, political communication and advertising. They work together to make better outcomes.
Skills or Advanced Trainings
	Many research suggests that interpersonal communication is essential for health professions to deliver health care (Dickson et al., 1996). There are two types of communication talking in this paper. The first is the communication between patients and health experts; another one is the communication between health agencies and the public. In the book Interpersonal relationships, the author lists some ethical theories and models for clinical judgement. They can influence the decision making: duty-based model, human rights-based model, and ethical dilemma (Arnold & Boggs, 2019, p.54). Acknowledging the patient’s psychological status and helping them under ethical rules is part of health professional’s training, and it is an important part.
	Public Relations practitioners working in this field generally need to deal with not only internal communication. They also need to handle external communicational needs, such as news, promoting services and public events (Page & Parnell, 2019). Based on a ranking posted by the Top Master’s In Healthcare Administration (n.d.), those positions usually require at least a bachelor’s degree in communications, which means some strategic communication skills and proper training are necessary. 
Future
Health communication is a growing industry, it has a wonderful future, with more opportunities to work on different aspects. For example, community relations, fund-raising, and internal communications are all great to provide the public with key health information (Page & Parnell, 2019). 
Recent years, the appearance of computer technology in healthcare changes the industry a lot. The usage of software programs and the Internet led to a different way that people could access health information. Communication technologies will continue to develop further and impact the health communication. The Internet has also become a tool for health providers (Wright et al., 2012). They could communicate and compete, finding out the most unique technique for featured customers.  One of the biggest information channels for people now is social media. In a journal the authors make the conclusion that “Social media brings a new dimension to health care as it offers a medium to be used by the public, patients, and health professionals to communicate about health issues with the possibility of potentially improving health outcomes” (Moorhead et al., 2013). More platforms provided for people to communicate will increase the speed of information exchange. 
However, some researchers think there are some challenges to the future of health communication. The next few decades the society will witness a large increase in older adults. Health problems tend to occur more frequently with aging. The healthcare system will suffer from many communication-related problems. For instance, the government may not have enough funds to support such a huge insurance system (Wright et al., 2012). As a result, there is a substantial need for health researchers to understand more in this industry associated with an aging population. Therefore, they can make a correct intervention and the aging issue will be solved. 
Personal Interest
If I pursue a job in Public Relations after I graduated, I do not think I would choose it in health communication. I am not interested in working in any science related areas. Although health communication does not require PR practitioners to have the complete education on medical studies, I still do not want to work for an industry that I have no passion for. I lost my interest in chemistry and physics in high school, because they can only have a right or wrong answer. I believe that does not apply in the real world. There will bever be an absolute correct answer for anything. I cannot see myself working in health communication.
Conclusion
It is true that health communication is a fast-growing industry, and it includes many important skills. Practitioners need to work with different communication needs. As stated before, the adoption of technology accelerates its growth, but there will be more challenges as well. This research is a great way to explore some significant elements in this profession.

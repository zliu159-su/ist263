    <h1>Blog 2: Media Story</h1>
    <p>
        Introduction<br>
        On Tuesday, a story posted an Instagram from a friend inspired me to have some milk tea at Marshall Street, because the picture she posted was tempting. As we can see, social media primarily influence people's lives. It has become the most common way to connect people around the world. People spent 144 minutes on social media in 2019 (Clement, 2020). Governments are aware of that, and the Internet has become a universal tool to express information. Public attitudes towards any event is easily shown through social media. Gender stereotypes and gender equality are topics that are frequently discussed. The movie Miss Representation is a project that helps spread women’s voices, disclosing their complaints of being treated unequally. For those women whose jobs require public attention, such as industries of entertainment, media, and politics, judgment is especially harsh. “Women are disproportionately emphasized of their traditional domestic roles and treated as sex objects” (Byerly, Ross, 2006, p.17).
        <br>Analysis<br>
        “Media is delivering content that is shaping our society; they are shaping our politics; most of all, they are shaping our children’s brains and lives and emotions” (Newsom, 2011). Millennials grew up in a time with the emergence of web technology. It has now a big part of our society. However, for many years, what does our media try to convey to children and teenagers? The U.S. spends 263.05 billion dollars in 2020 (Guttmann, 2019) that exceeds 80 percent of other countries’ GDP. People watch television and use the Internet every day. The advertisements they see are uncountable. If we pay attention and think about what those advertisements tell us, it comes out that gender bias is everywhere. Girls are told to be ideal for men since they are young. Photoshopped pictures show the society what women should look like, even if they are not real. Many girls have eating disorders, feel depressed, and not confident. Self-objectivity has now become a national problem in the United States. The media mislead young males that slim figures and romance daydreams are what every female is chasing. Teenagers’ brains are not mature enough to think independently; their thoughts can more easily be distorted. When they become adults, it will be difficult to change their minds.
        <br>Women do not want to be leaders. It is rare to see a female governor. From the movie, 67 countries have female presidents, but the United States is not one of them (Newsom, 2011). Having more female leaders could mean a lot to American politics. They spend more on beauty products instead of higher education, and that only keeps women away from these leadership positions, for those who have achieved leadership, the media judges and emphasizes their shortcomings in terms of appearance. Insulting words are used to describe Hillary Clinton and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Through these messages, women are discouraged from becoming political candidates. Without women in power, this society is not a place that is healthy and comfortable for women to live, and this change can only be made by themselves.
        <br>Conclusion<br>
        We want to create a healthier culture for the next generation. Women can be ambitious, and people should not judge their appearance simply because they are female. Most importantly, media need to use its vast social impact correctly to tell people the concept of gender equality. Women should gain the respect they deserve.
